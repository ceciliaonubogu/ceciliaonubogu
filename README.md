## About CyberNova Academy (Cohort: Cybersecurity SOC & GRC)
CyberNova Academy’s SOC & GRC Cohort is a hands-on, job-ready program designed to help learners build **real SOC analyst capability** (detection, triage, investigation, response) and **GRC capability** (risk, compliance, ISO 27001, Essential Eight alignment, audit readiness).

**What you will graduate with:**
- A GitHub portfolio with practical SOC labs + write-ups
- Evidence of detection engineering (KQL/SPL, dashboards, alerts, use cases)
- Incident response workflow experience (tickets, cases, playbooks, reports)
- GRC artifacts (risk register, policies, ISMS scope, audit evidence pack)
- Real-world tooling familiarity (SIEM, EDR, SOAR, threat intel, logging)

> :white_check_mark: This README is also a **portfolio template**: replace placeholder links with your own repos and completed projects.
